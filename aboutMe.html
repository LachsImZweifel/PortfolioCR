                    a very social person who likes to be around and work together with people. 
                    <br> I have a huge interest for different cultures and ways of living life, this is why I spend my late teens and early twenties exploring the world and its colorful people.
                    <br> This lead me to countries in Asia, South-America and Africa. I definitly learned something in all of these places, which helped me get more confident, independend and understanding towards completly different viewpoints and cultural beleaves.
                    <br>
                    <br> Furthermore I play football since I was about ten years old. This is very important to me, as it helpes me to release stress and also continous teaching me about how to be successfull and cooperate optimal as a group of ambitious individuals.
                    <br> Another great interest of mine is music. I love going to concerts and lately I am learning to play the saxophone. Its definitly challenging in terms of patience and consistancy but it's also a lot of fun!
